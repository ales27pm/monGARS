# Cognition Engine Protocol

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Guides orchestrators, schedulers, and memory abstractions under `monGARS/core/`.

## Automation

- Sourced from the central JSON profile; run the refresh command after substantial engine work.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Performance & Resilience**
  - ✅ Worker auto-tuning for Pi/Jetson (`recommended_worker_count`).
  - ✅ Multi-architecture build scripts and cache metrics.
  - ✅ Hardened RBAC manifests.
  - 🔄 Implement real masked next-token training in `MNTPTrainer` and wire Ray Serve HTTP requests in `LLMIntegration`.
  - 🔄 Pin container image versions in `docker-compose.yml` and extend Alembic migrations.
- **Self-Improvement**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - 🔄 Execute real self-training cycles instead of simulated versioning.
  - 🚧 Explore reinforcement learning loops and advanced scaling strategies.
  - 🔄 Expand tests for WebSockets, hardware utilities, and distributed workflows.

## Architectural Principles

- Keep orchestrators thin and asynchronous; inject collaborators and avoid module-level singletons.
- Prefer existing services (`Hippocampus`, `PersistenceRepository`, `DistributedScheduler`,
    `PeerCommunicator`) before inventing new state machines.
- Document new behaviours and heuristics in module docstrings.

## Operational Discipline

- Wrap blocking work with `asyncio.to_thread` or queue it on executors.
- Publish counters/metrics for long-running loops and redact sensitive identifiers in logs.
- Handle optional ML dependencies defensively with explicit fallbacks.

## Test Coverage

Expand cognition suites when behaviour shifts—`tests/test_hippocampus.py`,
`tests/test_personality.py`, `tests/test_mimicry.py`, and scheduler/evolution tests anchor this
area.
