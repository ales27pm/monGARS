# Test Suite Expectations

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Applies to everything in `tests/`, including async fixtures, integration checks, and long-running
suites.

## Automation

- Auto-generated; run the refresh command after adding new suites or fixtures.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Stability Assurance**
  - ✅ Align JWT algorithm with deployed secrets (HS256 enforced until managed key storage is available).
  - ✅ Store runtime secrets in Vault/Sealed Secrets instead of raw `k8s/secrets.yaml`.
  - ✅ Update Dockerfiles to run as non-root and add a `.dockerignore` to exclude secrets and build artefacts.
  - 🔄 Replace demo users in `web_api.py` with the database-backed authentication flow and migrations (default accounts still load at runtime and must be removed).
- **Research Coverage**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - 🔄 Reinforcement-learning research loops ship under `modules/neurons/training/reinforcement_loop.py`; integrate telemetry, rollout, and operator controls before calling the milestone complete.
  - 🔄 Expand tests for long-running MNTP jobs, multi-replica Ray Serve rollouts, and distributed workflows.

## Structure & Conventions

- Annotate async tests with `pytest.mark.asyncio` and lean on fixtures in `conftest.py`; never create
    event loops manually.
- Reset shared state (hippocampus caches, global singletons) in fixtures to keep tests hermetic.
- Stub heavy dependencies (Torch, spaCy, HTTP clients) with fakes or patches.

## Coverage Expectations

- Exercise success and failure paths for HTTP endpoints, WebSockets, and orchestration flows.
- Run `chaos_test.py`, `integration_test.py`, and `self_training_test.py` before releases or
    infrastructure-heavy changes.
- Constrain property-based tests to stay fast and deterministic.

## Tooling

Default command is `pytest -q`; use `pytest -k <pattern>` for focused runs and `pytest --maxfail=1`
for triage. Generate coverage with `pytest --cov=monGARS --cov=modules` when requested.
