# Test Suite Expectations

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Applies to everything in `tests/`, including async fixtures, integration checks, and long-running
suites.

## Automation

- Auto-generated; run the refresh command after adding new suites or fixtures.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Stability Assurance**
  - ✅ Align JWT algorithm with deployed secrets (HS256 enforced until managed key storage is available).
  - ✅ Store runtime secrets in Vault/Sealed Secrets instead of raw `k8s/secrets.yaml`.
  - ✅ Update Dockerfiles to run as non-root and add a `.dockerignore` to exclude secrets and build artefacts.
  - ✅ Replace demo users in `web_api.py` with the database-backed authentication flow and migrations; bootstrap now persists accounts without shipping in-memory defaults.【F:monGARS/api/authentication.py†L17-L120】【F:monGARS/api/web_api.py†L41-L120】
- **Research Coverage**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - ✅ Reinforcement-learning research loops run through the evolution orchestrator, operator approvals, and long-haul validator with telemetry and manifest updates.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L440】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】
  - ✅ ResearchLongHaulService now schedules multi-replica soak runs and persists observability snapshots for dashboards, ensuring reinforcement pipelines stay healthy without manual triggers.【F:monGARS/core/research_validation.py†L1-L200】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】【F:tests/test_research_long_haul_service.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L200-L320】
- **Sustainability Validation**
  - 🚧 Fully integrate evolution engine outputs into routine optimisation cycles.
  - 🚧 Automate energy usage reporting and advanced hardware-aware scaling using the energy tracker pipeline and reinforcement observability feeds as the baseline data source.【F:modules/evolution_engine/energy.py†L1-L160】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】
  - 🚧 Share optimisation artefacts between nodes for faster convergence.

## Structure & Conventions

- Annotate async tests with `pytest.mark.asyncio` and lean on fixtures in `conftest.py`; never create
    event loops manually.
- Reset shared state (hippocampus caches, global singletons) in fixtures to keep tests hermetic.
- Stub heavy dependencies (Torch, spaCy, HTTP clients) with fakes or patches to keep runs
    deterministic.

## Coverage Expectations

- Exercise success and failure paths for HTTP endpoints, WebSockets, orchestration flows,
    sustainability gates, and SDK tooling.
- Run `chaos_test.py`, `integration_test.py`, `self_training_test.py`, and reinforcement long-haul
    suites before releases or infrastructure-heavy changes.
- Constrain property-based tests to stay fast and deterministic; document skipped suites in PR notes.

## Tooling

Default command is `pytest`; run from the repository root so module paths resolve (631 tests
currently pass in ~110 seconds). Use `pytest -k <pattern>` for focused runs, `pytest --maxfail=1`
for triage, and `pytest --cov=monGARS --cov=modules` when coverage is required.

Invoke `npm run test` when frontend/TypeScript assets change so lint and Jest suites stay green.
