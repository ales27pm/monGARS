# monGARS

monGARS (Modular Neural Agent for Research and Support) is a privacy-first AI system designed for experimentation on low-resource hardware. The project bundles Python services, a Django web interface and container orchestration files so contributors can run or deploy the stack with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Conversational engine** powered by `LLMIntegration` with optional Ray Serve integration (URL configured via `RAY_SERVE_URL`).
- **Memory management** through the in-memory `Hippocampus` and persistent storage via `PersistenceRepository`.
- **Adaptive behaviour** using the `MimicryModule`, `PersonalityEngine` and `AdaptiveResponseGenerator`.
- **Web scraping** utilities provided by `Iris` for retrieving external context.
- **Tiered caching** (memory, Redis and disk) with graceful fallback handling.
- **Selfâ€‘training and monitoring** via `SelfTrainingEngine` and `SystemMonitor`.
- **Evolution Engine** for autonomous diagnostics and code optimization.
- **Web interface** implemented with Django (located in `webapp/`).
- **Automatic worker tuning** for Raspberry Pi and Jetson devices via `recommended_worker_count()`.
- **Worker deployment settings** configurable through `WORKER_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` and `WORKER_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE` environment variables used by the Evolution Engine.
- **Robust core detection** falls back to logical CPUs if physical cores cannot be determined.
- **Encrypted peer-to-peer messaging** via `PeerCommunicator` for basic node coordination.
- **Distributed task scheduling** handled by `DistributedScheduler` to share work between peers.
- **Idle-time optimization** through `SommeilParadoxal` which triggers upgrades when the system is quiet.
- **Safe optimization cycles** executed by `EvolutionEngine.safe_apply_optimizations`.

A high level component overview can be found in `monGARS_structure.txt`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
- Optional: GPU drivers for Nvidia containers

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust configuration values.
3. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python init_db.py
   ```
4. Launch services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This starts PostgreSQL, Redis, MLflow, Vault and an Ollama model server alongside the application.

### Running the Application

The main entry point is `main.py` which bootstraps monitoring tasks and exposes the FastAPI app under `monGARS.api.web_api`. During development you can run:

```bash
python main.py
```

On Raspberry Pi or Jetson boards the number of Uvicorn workers is
automatically reduced using `monGARS.utils.hardware.recommended_worker_count`.
The helper checks physical cores first and falls back to logical CPUs when
necessary.

The `/api/v1/peer/message` endpoint allows nodes to exchange encrypted messages
for basic coordination. This authenticated POST route accepts a JSON body of the
form `{"payload": "<encrypted>"}`.

Unit and integration tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Execute them with:

```bash
pytest
```

Code style is enforced using `black` and `isort` as outlined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Deployment

Production deployments can be containerised via the provided `Dockerfile`. Kubernetes manifests live in `k8s/` for cluster environments. Adjust resource limits and RBAC rules as required for your infrastructure.
Use `./build_embedded.sh` with Docker Buildx to build and push multi-architecture images for Raspberry Pi and Jetson using `Dockerfile.embedded`. Provide a repository name (e.g. `user/image:tag`) and ensure you're logged in to your container registry.
The `build_native.sh` helper builds an optimized x86_64 image tuned for fast compiles on a typical Intel i7 workstation.

## Contributing

Please read `AGENTS.md` for the contribution guide. Pull requests should be focused, include relevant tests and ensure `pytest` passes before submission. Documentation updates are encouraged whenever behaviour changes.

## Roadmap

Development milestones are tracked in `ROADMAP.md`. Upcoming phases include hardware optimization, collaborative networking and a full web API.

Community feedback and contributions are welcome!
