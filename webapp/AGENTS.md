# Django Webapp Guardrails

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Applies to the Django project in `webapp/`, covering async views, services, templates, and
middleware.

## Automation

- Refresh via the agents manager script to sync with roadmap and API contracts.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Web Interface Goals**
  - ✅ FastAPI chat/history/token endpoints with validation.
  - ✅ Django chat UI with progressive enhancement.
  - ✅ FastAPI WebSocket handler with ticket verification, history replay, and streaming guarded by `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS`.
  - ✅ Replaced hard-coded credential stores with database-backed auth flows; FastAPI no longer seeds demo credentials at startup.【F:monGARS/api/web_api.py†L41-L120】
  - ✅ Publish polished SDKs and reference clients with documented release flows.【F:docs/sdk-release-guide.md†L1-L160】【F:docs/sdk-overview.md†L1-L120】

## Views & Services

- Keep views asynchronous and delegate outbound HTTP calls to `chat/services.py` for centralised auth,
    retries, logging, and WebSocket ticket exchange.
- Pull configuration from environment variables/Django settings; never hardcode secrets or URLs and
    keep parity with FastAPI settings.
- Apply `require_token` to authenticated routes and document context variables in docstrings.

## Templates & Frontend

- Keep business logic in views/services; templates focus on presentation with progressive enhancement
    and localisation-ready strings.
- Ensure JavaScript bundles built via `webapp/static/js/build.mjs` have graceful degradation paths;
    run `npm run lint`/`npm run test` when editing them.

## Testing

Update `tests/test_webapp_chat_services.py`, `tests/test_webapp_settings.py`,
`tests/test_webapp_database_settings.py`, and `tests/test_websocket.py` when UI flows change; mock
FastAPI interactions with `respx`/`httpx`.
