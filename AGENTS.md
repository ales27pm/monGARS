# monGARS Delivery Charter

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Applies to every repository change. Nested AGENTS.md files add stricter rules; this root charter
highlights the non-negotiable guardrails and shared context.
Placeholders, stubs, mocks, incomplete or simplified code is not allowed. 
Only refine full working logic and code will be accepted.


## Automation

- Generated via `python scripts/manage_agents.py refresh`. Edit the JSON profile instead of the
    Markdown when updating scope or requirements.
- Run `python scripts/manage_agents.py create <directory>` to scaffold a scoped AGENTS.md when a new
    subsystem lands.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Security & Stability Hotlist**
  - ✅ Align JWT algorithm with deployed secrets (HS256 enforced until managed key storage is available).
  - ✅ Store runtime secrets in Vault/Sealed Secrets instead of raw `k8s/secrets.yaml`.
  - ✅ Update Dockerfiles to run as non-root and add a `.dockerignore` to exclude secrets and build artefacts.
  - ✅ Replace demo users in `web_api.py` with the database-backed authentication flow and migrations; bootstrap now persists accounts without shipping in-memory defaults.【F:monGARS/api/authentication.py†L17-L120】【F:monGARS/api/web_api.py†L41-L120】
- **Web/API Refinement**
  - ✅ FastAPI chat/history/token endpoints with validation.
  - ✅ Django chat UI with progressive enhancement.
  - ✅ FastAPI WebSocket handler with ticket verification, history replay, and streaming guarded by `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS`.
  - ✅ Replaced hard-coded credential stores with database-backed auth flows; FastAPI no longer seeds demo credentials at startup.【F:monGARS/api/web_api.py†L41-L120】
  - ✅ Publish polished SDKs and reference clients with documented release flows.【F:docs/sdk-release-guide.md†L1-L160】【F:docs/sdk-overview.md†L1-L120】
- **Self-Improvement & Research**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - ✅ Reinforcement-learning research loops run through the evolution orchestrator, operator approvals, and long-haul validator with telemetry and manifest updates.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L440】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】
  - ✅ ResearchLongHaulService now schedules multi-replica soak runs and persists observability snapshots for dashboards, ensuring reinforcement pipelines stay healthy without manual triggers.【F:monGARS/core/research_validation.py†L1-L200】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】【F:tests/test_research_long_haul_service.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L200-L320】
- **Sustainability & Longevity**
  - 🚧 Fully integrate evolution engine outputs into routine optimisation cycles.
  - 🚧 Automate energy usage reporting and advanced hardware-aware scaling using the energy tracker pipeline and reinforcement observability feeds as the baseline data source.【F:modules/evolution_engine/energy.py†L1-L160】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】
  - 🚧 Share optimisation artefacts between nodes for faster convergence.

## Workflow Guardrails

- Target **Python 3.11** for backend tooling and **Node.js 18+** for frontend builds.
- Format Python with `black` and `isort` (configured via `pyproject.toml`) and lint
    TypeScript/JavaScript assets with `npm run lint` before committing.
- Run `pytest` (631 tests, ~110s) and record skips; execute `npm run test` when web assets or SDKs
    change.
- Document architecture, configuration, and operator workflow changes in `docs/` or the README before
    shipping.
- Regenerate these instructions with `python scripts/manage_agents.py refresh` after editing
    `configs/agents/agents_config.json`.

## Observability & Security

- Load configuration through `monGARS.config.get_settings()` so cached settings stay coherent across
    services.
- Redact secrets in logs and wire new background tasks into `monGARS.telemetry` counters and
    OpenTelemetry toggles (`otel_prometheus_enabled`, `otel_traces_enabled`).
- Keep Dockerfiles, Compose stacks, and Kubernetes manifests aligned; review Vault/ExternalSecret
    usage whenever credentials change.

## Documentation & Runbooks

- Update runbooks, diagrams, and `monGARS_structure.txt` whenever module layout or workflows shift.
- Cross-link roadmap entries, docs, and code so operators can trace feature readiness and
    configuration changes.
