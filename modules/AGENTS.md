# Optional Modules Charter

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Covers optional subsystems under `modules/`, including evolution and neuron trainers.

## Automation

- Generated from the shared JSON profile; use the manager script to refresh.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Self-Improvement Focus**
  - _(No matching roadmap entries for `Phase 6 ‚Äì Self-Improvement & Research (üóì Target Q2 2026)`)_

## Design Tenets

- Gate heavy dependencies (Torch, datasets, GPU tooling) behind runtime checks with informative
    warnings.
- Accept configuration via explicit parameters or config bundles from `configs/`.
- Log with contextual metadata (model, dataset, artefact path) using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

## Documentation & Testing

- Add scoped AGENTS.md files for new subpackages and update `monGARS_structure.txt`.
- Keep `tests/test_evolution_engine.py` and `tests/test_mntp_trainer.py` current as features evolve;
    patch heavy integrations for speed.
