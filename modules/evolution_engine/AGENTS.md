# Evolution Engine Playbook

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Defines how retraining orchestration and self-healing pipelines behave under
`modules/evolution_engine/`.

## Automation

- Managed by the global agents script.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Self-Training Execution**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - ✅ Reinforcement-learning research loops run through the evolution orchestrator, operator approvals, and long-haul validator with telemetry and manifest updates.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L440】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】
  - ✅ ResearchLongHaulService now schedules multi-replica soak runs and persists observability snapshots for dashboards, ensuring reinforcement pipelines stay healthy without manual triggers.【F:monGARS/core/research_validation.py†L1-L200】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】【F:tests/test_research_long_haul_service.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L200-L320】
- **Sustainability Coordination**
  - 🚧 Fully integrate evolution engine outputs into routine optimisation cycles.
  - 🚧 Automate energy usage reporting and advanced hardware-aware scaling using the energy tracker pipeline and reinforcement observability feeds as the baseline data source.【F:modules/evolution_engine/energy.py†L1-L160】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】
  - 🚧 Share optimisation artefacts between nodes for faster convergence.

## Pipeline Discipline

- Keep `EvolutionOrchestrator` focused on sequencing; instantiate trainers from
    `modules.neurons.training` and return artefact metadata for catalog updates.
- Represent pipeline stages with explicit methods for validation, training, deployment, rollback, and
    sustainability checks.
- Wrap external calls with targeted exception handling—log the action, include artefact identifiers,
    and propagate unexpected errors.

## Configuration

- Default to configs in `configs/training/` (`mntp_dolphin_config.json`, sustainability policies) with
    constructor overrides for deterministic tests.
- Document config changes in the README/docs and roadmap when defaults move or new sustainability
    gates are added.

## Validation

Extend `tests/test_evolution_engine.py`, `tests/test_sustainability_policy.py`, and long-haul
integration tests to cover success, failure, artefact validation, and sustainability gate scenarios.
Use fakes for `MNTPTrainer` in unit tests.
