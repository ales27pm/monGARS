# Evolution Engine Playbook

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Defines how retraining orchestration and self-healing pipelines behave under
`modules/evolution_engine/`.

## Automation

- Managed by the global agents script.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Self-Training Execution**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - ✅ Reinforcement-learning research loops run through the evolution orchestrator, operator approvals, and long-haul validator with telemetry and manifest updates.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L440】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】
  - 🔄 Expand tests and dashboards for long-running MNTP jobs, multi-replica Ray Serve rollouts, and energy telemetry correlation across distributed workflows.【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L156-L226】

## Pipeline Discipline

- Keep `EvolutionOrchestrator` focused on sequencing; instantiate trainers from
    `modules.neurons.training` and return artefact metadata.
- Represent pipeline stages with explicit methods for validation, training, deployment, and rollback.
- Wrap external calls with targeted exception handling—log the action and propagate unexpected errors.

## Configuration

- Default to `configs/training/mntp_dolphin_config.json` with constructor overrides for deterministic
    tests.
- Document config changes in the README and roadmap when defaults move.

## Validation

Extend `tests/test_evolution_engine.py` to cover success, failure, and artefact validation
scenarios. Use fakes for `MNTPTrainer` in unit tests.
