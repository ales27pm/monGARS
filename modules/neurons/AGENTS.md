# Neuron Trainer Guidelines

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Applies to neuron trainers and utilities under `modules/neurons/`.

## Automation

- Auto-updated via the agents manager script.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Training Cadence**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - ✅ Reinforcement-learning research loops run through the evolution orchestrator, operator approvals, and long-haul validator with telemetry and manifest updates.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L440】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】
  - ✅ ResearchLongHaulService now schedules multi-replica soak runs and persists observability snapshots for dashboards, ensuring reinforcement pipelines stay healthy without manual triggers.【F:monGARS/core/research_validation.py†L1-L200】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】【F:tests/test_research_long_haul_service.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L200-L320】
- **Sustainability Hooks**
  - 🚧 Fully integrate evolution engine outputs into routine optimisation cycles.
  - 🚧 Automate energy usage reporting and advanced hardware-aware scaling using the energy tracker pipeline and reinforcement observability feeds as the baseline data source.【F:modules/evolution_engine/energy.py†L1-L160】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】
  - 🚧 Share optimisation artefacts between nodes for faster convergence.

## Runtime Expectations

- Import heavy ML frameworks lazily; fall back gracefully when dependencies are missing and document
    deterministic adapter paths.
- Accept explicit arguments for output directories, manifests, approvals, and config paths so
    orchestration remains testable.
- Persist artefacts with helper methods (e.g., `_save_config`, `_save_placeholder`) and document
    layouts in docstrings for catalog consumers.

## Telemetry & Tests

- Stream progress logs with model, dataset, loss, and sustainability context; emit metrics when long-
    running jobs are introduced.
- Keep `tests/test_mntp_trainer.py`, `tests/test_reinforcement_loop.py`, and
    `tests/test_training_pipeline.py` up to date and constrain property-based tests for speed.
