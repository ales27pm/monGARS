# Neuron Trainer Guidelines

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Applies to neuron trainers and utilities under `modules/neurons/`.

## Automation

- Auto-updated via the agents manager script.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Training Cadence**
  - ✅ Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
  - ✅ Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
  - ✅ Reinforcement-learning research loops run through the evolution orchestrator, operator approvals, and long-haul validator with telemetry and manifest updates.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L440】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】
  - 🔄 Expand tests and dashboards for long-running MNTP jobs, multi-replica Ray Serve rollouts, and energy telemetry correlation across distributed workflows.【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L1-L220】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L156-L226】

## Runtime Expectations

- Import heavy ML frameworks lazily; fall back gracefully when dependencies are missing.
- Accept explicit arguments for output directories, manifests, and config paths to keep orchestration
    testable.
- Persist artefacts with helper methods (e.g., `_save_config`, `_save_placeholder`) and document
    layouts in docstrings.

## Telemetry & Tests

- Stream progress logs with model, dataset, and loss context; emit metrics when long-running jobs are
    introduced.
- Keep `tests/test_mntp_trainer.py` up to date and constrain property-based tests for speed.
