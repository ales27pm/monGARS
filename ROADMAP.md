# monGARS Project Roadmap

This roadmap summarizes the planned phases for monGARS based on the current architecture and goals.

## Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure
- [x] Establish module framework (Cortex, Hippocampus, Neurons, Bouche).
- [x] Integrate basic memory storage and conversation flow.
- [x] Provide Docker Compose and initial deployment scripts.

## Phase 2 – Functional Expansion
- [x] Add Mimicry for behavioral adaptation and Mains Virtuelles for executing user-defined code.
- Expand web scraping via Iris and refine the Curiosity Engine.
- [x] Introduce extended tests and monitoring.

## Phase 3 – Hardware Integration
- Optimize for low-resource devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano).
- Prepare containers for custom hardware platforms.
- Continue performance profiling and security hardening.

## Phase 4 – Collaborative Networking
- Implement peer-to-peer coordination across multiple monGARS instances.
- Enhance Sommeil Paradoxal for autonomous optimization during idle time.
- Finalize Evolution Engine for sandboxed updates.

This roadmap will evolve as the project matures. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
