# monGARS Roadmap

This roadmap reflects the verified state of the codebase and the milestones
required to reach production readiness.

## Immediate Priorities (Security & Stability)

- âœ… Align JWT algorithm with deployed secrets (HS256 enforced until managed key storage is available).
- âœ… Store runtime secrets in Vault/Sealed Secrets instead of raw `k8s/secrets.yaml`.
- âœ… Update Dockerfiles to run as non-root and add a `.dockerignore` to exclude
  secrets and build artefacts.
- ðŸ”„ Replace demo users in `web_api.py` with the database-backed authentication
  flow and migrations (default accounts still load at runtime and must be
  removed).

## Phase 1 â€“ Core Infrastructure (âœ… Completed Q1 2025)

- Established core cognition modules (Cortex, Hippocampus, Neurons, Bouche).
- Delivered Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests for local/cluster deployment.

## Phase 2 â€“ Functional Expansion (âœ… Completed Q2 2025)

- Landed Mimicry, Personality, Adaptive Response, and image captioning modules.
- Integrated Iris scraping and Curiosity Engine for external research.
- Replaced placeholder tests with meaningful coverage for circuit breakers,
  caching, and self-training.

## Phase 3 â€“ Hardware & Performance (âœ… Completed Q3 2025)

- âœ… Worker auto-tuning for Pi/Jetson (`recommended_worker_count`).
- âœ… Multi-architecture build scripts and cache metrics.
- âœ… Hardened RBAC manifests.
- âœ… Ray Serve HTTP integration with circuit breaking plus MNTP trainer support
  for LoRA and curated adapters.
- âœ… Extend Alembic migrations for the newest SQLModel tables, including legacy
  tables created outside the current ORM layer.
- âœ… Expose Ray Serve success/failure counters via OpenTelemetry (`llm.ray.*`
  metrics emitted by `LLMIntegration`).

## Phase 4 â€“ Collaborative Networking (âœ… Completed Q4 2025)

- âœ… Encrypted peer registry, admin-guarded endpoints, and distributed scheduler.
- âœ… Sommeil Paradoxal idle-time optimisation and safe apply pipeline.
- âœ… Implemented load-aware scheduling strategies and shared optimisation telemetry
  across nodes.

## Phase 5 â€“ Web Interface & API Refinement (ðŸ”„ In Progress, Target Q1 2026)

- âœ… FastAPI chat/history/token endpoints with validation.
- âœ… Django chat UI with progressive enhancement.
- âœ… FastAPI WebSocket handler with ticket verification, history replay, and
  streaming guarded by `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS`.
- ðŸ”„ Replaced hard-coded credential stores with database-backed auth flows (the
  `DEFAULT_USERS` bootstrap in `monGARS/api/web_api.py` still provisions demo
  accounts until the cleanup lands).
- ðŸš§ Publish polished SDKs and reference clients.

## Phase 6 â€“ Self-Improvement & Research (ðŸ—“ Target Q2 2026)

- âœ… Personality profiles persisted via SQLModel with live adapter updates.
- âœ… Self-training cycles produce real adapter artefacts via
  `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` with deterministic fallbacks.
- ðŸ”„ Reinforcement-learning research loops ship under
  `modules/neurons/training/reinforcement_loop.py`; integrate telemetry,
  rollout, and operator controls before calling the milestone complete.
- ðŸ”„ Expand tests for long-running MNTP jobs, multi-replica Ray Serve rollouts,
  and distributed workflows.

## Phase 7 â€“ Sustainability & Longevity (ðŸŒ± Future)

- ðŸš§ Fully integrate evolution engine outputs into routine optimisation cycles.
- ðŸš§ Automate energy usage reporting and advanced hardware-aware scaling.
- ðŸš§ Share optimisation artefacts between nodes for faster convergence.
