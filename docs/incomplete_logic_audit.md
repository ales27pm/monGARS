# Incomplete Logic Audit

## Date: 2025-09-30

This follow-up audit re-runs and expands the repository-wide scan for patterns
that typically signal unfinished implementations. The review covered the core
runtime packages under `monGARS/`, optional research modules, the FastAPI
service surface, CLI entry points, and test support utilities.

## Scope & Methodology

| Check | Purpose | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rg "TODO"` | Track high-level work markers left in code comments. | No matches. |
| `rg "FIXME"` / `rg "XXX"` | Catch lower-level bug markers or temporary hacks. | No matches. |
| `rg "NotImplemented"` | Identify deliberate stubs raising `NotImplementedError`. | One test double (documented below). |
| `rg "\\bpass\\b" monGARS` | Locate `pass` statements inside runtime modules. | Five runtime locations reviewed. |
| Manual inspection | Review each match in surrounding context to confirm intent and downstream behaviour. | Completed. |

The search excludes vendor directories and build artefacts. For each match, the
surrounding control flow was inspected to verify that the clause represents an
intentional no-op (for example, expected cancellation handling) rather than an
unfinished branch.

## Findings

### `NotImplementedError`

| Location | Context | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/test_dynamic_response.py:15` | `StubStyleTuner.estimate_personality` raises to ensure production inference code is not called inside caching tests. | Safe: confined to test double used to assert guard-rail behaviour. |

No runtime modules raise `NotImplementedError`.

### `pass` Statements

| Location | Scenario | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `monGARS/api/ws_manager.py:245` | `except WebSocketDisconnect` in the connection loop. | The no-op acknowledges normal client disconnects; cleanup runs in the `finally` block immediately after the exception handler. |
| `monGARS/core/distributed_scheduler.py:217` | `except asyncio.CancelledError` in worker coroutine. | Cancellation during shutdown is expected; worker finalisation (metrics + deregistration) executes in the enclosing `finally` block. |
| `monGARS/core/sommeil.py:49` | `except asyncio.CancelledError` in background optimisation loop. | Allows cooperative cancellation when stopping the idle optimisation task. |
| `monGARS/core/sommeil.py:77` | `except asyncio.CancelledError` while awaiting task cancellation during shutdown. | Mirrors the background loop handling to treat cancellation as non-fatal. |
| `monGARS/core/security.py:71` | `except ModuleNotFoundError` when probing for `bcrypt`. | Falls back to the pure-Python `pbkdf2_sha256` hashing scheme when the optional `bcrypt` dependency is missing. |

During review, every `pass` lands in expected defensive branches: cancellation,
resource teardown, or optional dependency probing. No branch was left without a
subsequent cleanup or logging path.

### False Positives

A small number of ripgrep matches originated from docstrings or comments (for
example, "pass-through" in `monGARS/api/ws_ticket.py`). These were verified and
require no action.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

- The production runtime has no uncovered `NotImplementedError` pathways and no
  `pass` statements that would swallow actionable failures.
- Cancellation and optional dependency fallbacks are already paired with
  surrounding cleanup or logging, so they do not represent incomplete logic.
- A new guardrail test (`tests/test_incomplete_logic_guardrails.py`) now enforces
  the absence of `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, and unapproved
  `NotImplementedError` markers across Python sources so regressions surface in
  CI.
- Re-run the command set above after major feature merges or dependency
  upgrades to complement the automated checks.

No corrective code changes are required beyond the guardrail automation that is
now part of the test suite.
