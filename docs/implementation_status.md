# Implementation Status Overview

Last updated: 2025-10-05

This report reconciles the roadmap with the current codebase. Each phase notes
what has shipped, what remains, and any discrepancies between historical plans
and reality.

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Infrastructure (Completed Q1 2025)

- Cortex, Hippocampus, Neurons, and Bouche modules exist with concrete
  orchestrations (`monGARS/core/conversation.py`, `monGARS/core/bouche.py`).
- Memory stack combines in-memory Hippocampus with SQLModel persistence and
  thread-safe locks.
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests provision FastAPI, Postgres, Redis,
  MLflow, Vault, and Ollama for local and cluster deployment.

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Functional Expansion (Completed Q2 2025)

- Mimicry, Personality, Adaptive Response, and BLIP-powered captioning modules
  personalise chat output while guarding optional dependencies.
- Iris scraping and the Curiosity Engine perform asynchronous retrieval with
  graceful fallbacks to local document ingestion when the external service is
  unavailable.
- The test suite covers chaos, property-based cache guarantees, self-training,
  WebSocket flows, Ray Serve, and API contracts (`tests/test_websocket.py`,
  `tests/test_llm_ray.py`, `tests/test_api_chat.py`).
- RAG enrichment is now part of the baseline feature set with dedicated FastAPI
  endpoints and typed client utilities.

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Hardware & Performance Optimisation (Completed Q3 2025)

- ‚úÖ Worker auto-tuning for Raspberry Pi/Jetson via
  `monGARS.utils.hardware.recommended_worker_count()`.
- ‚úÖ Multi-architecture build scripts (`build_embedded.sh`, `build_native.sh`) and
  corresponding Dockerfiles.
- ‚úÖ Tiered cache metrics exported through OpenTelemetry plus scheduler gauges in
  `monGARS/core/distributed_scheduler.py`.
- ‚úÖ Ray Serve integration issues real HTTP requests with circuit breaking,
  endpoint rotation, and adapter manifest awareness in
  `monGARS/core/llm_integration.py`.
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose pins images for Postgres/Redis/MLflow and defaults to a tagged
  application image (`mongars-app:0.1.0`).
- ‚úÖ `LLMIntegration` now emits `llm.ray.requests`, `llm.ray.failures`,
  `llm.ray.scaling_events`, and latency histograms via OpenTelemetry, unlocking
  distributed inference dashboards without parsing logs.
- ‚úÖ Alembic revision `20250304_01_align_sqlmodel_tables.py` adds deterministic
  defaults, backfills legacy data, and creates the historical
  `conversation_sessions`/`emotion_trends` tables so deployments no longer depend
  on ad-hoc bootstrap scripts.

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Collaborative Networking (Completed Q4 2025)

- ‚úÖ Peer registry, encrypted messaging, and admin-guarded endpoints are live.
- ‚úÖ DistributedScheduler and Sommeil Paradoxal coordinate idle-time optimisation
  and background jobs, broadcasting health metrics to peers.
- ‚úÖ Safe optimisation wrappers prevent destructive upgrades by executing changes in
  a sandbox.
- ‚úÖ Load-aware scheduling now factors queue depth, peer telemetry, and historical
  failure rates when selecting targets
  (`monGARS/core/distributed_scheduler.py`, `monGARS/core/peer.py`).

## Phase 5 ‚Äì Web Interface & API Refinement (In Progress ‚Äì Target Q1 2026)

- FastAPI routes for `/token`, `/api/v1/conversation/chat`,
  `/api/v1/conversation/history`, `/api/v1/review/rag-context`, and peer
  management are implemented with Pydantic validation.
- Django chat UI renders progressive templates, and the FastAPI WebSocket handler
  (`monGARS/api/ws_manager.py`) now authenticates signed tickets issued by
  `/api/v1/auth/ws/ticket`, replays history, and streams responses when
  `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS` is true.
- Database-backed authentication is the default: `PersistenceRepository`
  persists user records, and login bootstrap flows now rely exclusively on
  persisted accounts after retiring the legacy demo credential mapping in
  `monGARS/api/web_api.py`.
- Planned work: consolidate validation rules and formalise RAG dataset
  governance before widening partner access.

## Phase 6 ‚Äì Self-Improvement & Research (Target Q2 2026)

- ‚úÖ Personality profiles persist via SQLModel and reload into memory-backed
  caches on demand.
- ‚úÖ SelfTrainingEngine batches curated records, persists anonymised datasets, and
  launches `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` for both curated
  linear adapters and LoRA fine-tuning when dependencies are available.
- üîÑ Reinforcement learning research loops now live in
  `modules/neurons/training/reinforcement_loop.py`, complete with adaptive
  scaling strategies and summary telemetry. Integration with production
  automation and long-haul observability remains outstanding, so the milestone
  stays in progress until rollout controls land.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing coverage for cognition and scheduling modules is solid; expand
  end-to-end evaluations for long-running MNTP jobs and multi-replica Ray Serve
  rollouts before declaring the phase complete.

## Phase 7 ‚Äì Sustainability & Longevity (Future)

- Evolution Engine orchestrates diagnostics and safe optimisation cycles, now
  backed by tangible adapter artefacts.
- Energy-usage reporting, advanced hardware-aware scaling, and cross-node sharing
  of optimisation artefacts remain open research topics.

## Key Contradictions & Actions

- ‚úÖ **JWT alignment**: configuration and security manager now enforce HS256,
  deferring asymmetric keys until managed storage is available.
- ‚úÖ **Secret storage**: Kubernetes manifests source credentials from Vault via
  an `ExternalSecret`, replacing inline Kubernetes `Secret` manifests.„ÄêF:k8s/secrets.yaml‚Ä†L1-L52„Äë
- ‚úÖ **Schema evolution**: Alembic migrations cover every ORM model and legacy
  table, allowing production rollouts without `init_db.py` fallbacks.
- ‚úÖ **Telemetry integration**: Ray Serve success, failure, and scaling counters
  are exported via OpenTelemetry and wired into peer telemetry broadcasts.
- ‚úÖ **Credential hardening**: default demo accounts have been removed and the
  login bootstrap now relies exclusively on persisted accounts, with initial
  admin creation handled through the dedicated `/api/v1/user/register/admin`
  endpoint when no privileged accounts exist.
- ‚úÖ **SDK story**: Python and TypeScript SDKs ship with documented release
  tooling, allowing partners to integrate without scraping OpenAPI definitions.„ÄêF:sdks/python/README.md‚Ä†L1-L120„Äë„ÄêF:docs/sdk-release-guide.md‚Ä†L1-L160„Äë
- **RAG governance**: document retention policies for curated datasets stored
  under `models/datasets/curated/` and ensure operators scrub sensitive context
  before exporting artefacts.
- **Advanced research loops**: wire the reinforcement-learning utilities into
  production workflows (telemetry, rollback, operator approval) before closing
  the milestone.

## Next Critical Implementation

With SDK packaging complete, the next critical implementation is codifying RAG
retention and export governance. Establishing automated scrubbing checks and
operator playbooks keeps curated datasets compliant as partner access expands
and unlocks the remaining controls in Phase 5.
