# Implementation Status Overview

_Last updated: 2025-10-20_

This report reconciles the roadmap with the current codebase. Each phase notes
what has shipped, what remains, and any discrepancies between historical plans
and reality.

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Infrastructure (Completed Q1 2025)

- Cortex, Hippocampus, Neurons, and Bouche modules exist with concrete
  orchestrations (`monGARS/core/conversation.py`, `monGARS/core/bouche.py`).
- Memory stack combines in-memory Hippocampus with SQLModel persistence and
  thread-safe locks.
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests provision FastAPI, Postgres, Redis,
  MLflow, Vault, and Ollama for local and cluster deployment.

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Functional Expansion (Completed Q2 2025)

- Mimicry, Personality, Adaptive Response, and BLIP-powered captioning modules
  personalise chat output while guarding optional dependencies.
- Iris scraping and the Curiosity Engine perform asynchronous retrieval with
  graceful fallbacks to local document ingestion when the external service is
  unavailable.
- The test suite covers chaos, property-based cache guarantees, self-training,
  WebSocket flows, Ray Serve, and API contracts (`tests/test_websocket.py`,
  `tests/test_llm_ray.py`, `tests/test_api_chat.py`).
- RAG enrichment is now part of the baseline feature set with dedicated FastAPI
  endpoints and typed client utilities.

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Hardware & Performance Optimisation (In Progress ‚Äì Target Q3 2025)

- ‚úÖ Worker auto-tuning for Raspberry Pi/Jetson via
  `monGARS.utils.hardware.recommended_worker_count()`.
- ‚úÖ Multi-architecture build scripts (`build_embedded.sh`, `build_native.sh`) and
  corresponding Dockerfiles.
- ‚úÖ Tiered cache metrics exported through OpenTelemetry plus scheduler gauges in
  `monGARS/core/distributed_scheduler.py`.
- ‚úÖ Ray Serve integration issues real HTTP requests with circuit breaking,
  endpoint rotation, and adapter manifest awareness in
  `monGARS/core/llm_integration.py`.
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose pins images for Postgres/Redis/MLflow and defaults to a tagged
  application image (`mongars-app:0.1.0`).
- ‚úÖ `LLMIntegration` now emits `llm.ray.requests`, `llm.ray.failures`,
  `llm.ray.scaling_events`, and latency histograms via OpenTelemetry, unlocking
  distributed inference dashboards without parsing logs.
- üîÑ Outstanding: expand Alembic migrations for the latest SQLModel tables,
  including legacy `conversation_sessions` and `emotion_trends` artefacts that
  the ORM no longer materialises.

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Collaborative Networking (In Progress ‚Äì Target Q4 2025)

- Peer registry, encrypted messaging, and admin-guarded endpoints are live.
- DistributedScheduler and Sommeil Paradoxal coordinate idle-time optimisation
  and background jobs, broadcasting health metrics to peers.
- Safe optimisation wrappers prevent destructive upgrades by executing changes in
  a sandbox.
- Remaining gaps: richer peer reputation scoring and replication of evolution
  artefacts across the mesh.

## Phase 5 ‚Äì Web Interface & API Refinement (Target Q1 2026)

- FastAPI routes for `/token`, `/api/v1/conversation/chat`,
  `/api/v1/conversation/history`, `/api/v1/review/rag-context`, and peer
  management are implemented with Pydantic validation.
- Django chat UI renders progressive templates, and the FastAPI WebSocket handler
  (`monGARS/api/ws_manager.py`) now authenticates signed tickets issued by
  `/api/v1/auth/ws/ticket`, replays history, and streams responses when
  `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS` is true.
- Planned work: consolidate validation rules, migrate demo credentials to the
  database-backed auth flow, and publish polished client SDKs.

## Phase 6 ‚Äì Self-Improvement & Research (Target Q2 2026)

- ‚úÖ Personality profiles persist via SQLModel and reload into memory-backed
  caches on demand.
- ‚úÖ SelfTrainingEngine batches curated records, persists anonymised datasets, and
  launches `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` for both curated
  linear adapters and LoRA fine-tuning when dependencies are available.
- üöß Reinforcement learning experiments remain future work. Open design notes in
  `docs/advanced_fine_tuning.md` describe candidate reward signals and replay
  buffers, but no executable pipeline exists yet.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing coverage for cognition and scheduling modules is solid; expand
  end-to-end evaluations for long-running MNTP jobs and multi-replica Ray Serve
  rollouts before declaring the phase complete.

## Phase 7 ‚Äì Sustainability & Longevity (Future)

- Evolution Engine orchestrates diagnostics and safe optimisation cycles, now
  backed by tangible adapter artefacts.
- Energy-usage reporting, advanced hardware-aware scaling, and cross-node sharing
  of optimisation artefacts remain open research topics.

## Key Contradictions & Actions

- ‚úÖ **JWT alignment**: configuration and security manager now enforce HS256,
  deferring asymmetric keys until managed storage is available.
- **Schema evolution**: add Alembic migrations for new persistence tables so
  deployments avoid relying on `init_db.py` bootstrap runs, and reconcile
  historical tables (`conversation_sessions`, `emotion_trends`) with the current
  ORM.
- **Telemetry integration**: forward the existing `llm.ray.*` metrics to
  dashboards/alerts so distributed inference regressions surface quickly.
- **Credential hardening**: replace demo admin bootstrapping with the
  database-backed auth workflow before exposing the stack beyond trusted labs.
- **RAG operations**: document retention policies for the curated datasets stored
  under `models/datasets/curated/` and ensure operators scrub sensitive context
  before exporting artefacts.
