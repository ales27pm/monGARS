# Implementation Status Overview

Last updated: 2026-02-18

This report reconciles the roadmap with the current codebase. Each phase notes
what has shipped, what remains, and any discrepancies between historical plans
and reality.

## Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure (Completed Q1 2025)

- Cortex, Hippocampus, Neurons, and Bouche modules exist with concrete
  orchestrations (`monGARS/core/conversation.py`, `monGARS/core/bouche.py`).
- Memory stack combines in-memory Hippocampus with SQLModel persistence and
  thread-safe locks.
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests provision FastAPI, Postgres, Redis,
  MLflow, Vault, and Ollama for local and cluster deployment.

## Phase 2 – Functional Expansion (Completed Q2 2025)

- Mimicry, Personality, Adaptive Response, and BLIP-powered captioning modules
  personalise chat output while guarding optional dependencies.
- Iris scraping and the Curiosity Engine perform asynchronous retrieval with
  graceful fallbacks to local document ingestion when the external service is
  unavailable.
- The test suite covers chaos, property-based cache guarantees, self-training,
  WebSocket flows, Ray Serve, and API contracts (`tests/test_websocket.py`,
  `tests/test_llm_ray.py`, `tests/test_api_chat.py`).
- RAG enrichment is now part of the baseline feature set with dedicated FastAPI
  endpoints and typed client utilities.

## Phase 3 – Hardware & Performance Optimisation (Completed Q3 2025)

- ✅ Worker auto-tuning for Raspberry Pi/Jetson via
  `monGARS.utils.hardware.recommended_worker_count()`.
- ✅ Multi-architecture build scripts (`build_embedded.sh`, `build_native.sh`) and
  corresponding Dockerfiles.
- ✅ Tiered cache metrics exported through OpenTelemetry plus scheduler gauges in
  `monGARS/core/distributed_scheduler.py`.
- ✅ Ray Serve integration issues real HTTP requests with circuit breaking,
  endpoint rotation, and adapter manifest awareness in
  `monGARS/core/llm_integration.py`.
- ✅ Docker Compose pins images for Postgres/Redis/MLflow and defaults to a tagged
  application image (`mongars-app:0.1.0`).
- ✅ `LLMIntegration` now emits `llm.ray.requests`, `llm.ray.failures`,
  `llm.ray.scaling_events`, and latency histograms via OpenTelemetry, unlocking
  distributed inference dashboards without parsing logs.
- ✅ Alembic revision `20250304_01_align_sqlmodel_tables.py` adds deterministic
  defaults, backfills legacy data, and creates the historical
  `conversation_sessions`/`emotion_trends` tables so deployments no longer depend
  on ad-hoc bootstrap scripts.

## Phase 4 – Collaborative Networking (Completed Q4 2025)

- ✅ Peer registry, encrypted messaging, and admin-guarded endpoints are live.
- ✅ DistributedScheduler and Sommeil Paradoxal coordinate idle-time optimisation
  and background jobs, broadcasting health metrics to peers.
- ✅ Safe optimisation wrappers prevent destructive upgrades by executing changes in
  a sandbox.
- ✅ Load-aware scheduling now factors queue depth, peer telemetry, and historical
  failure rates when selecting targets
  (`monGARS/core/distributed_scheduler.py`, `monGARS/core/peer.py`).

## Phase 5 – Web Interface & API Refinement (Completed Q4 2025)

- FastAPI routes for `/token`, `/api/v1/conversation/chat`,
  `/api/v1/conversation/history`, `/api/v1/review/rag-context`, and peer
  management are implemented with Pydantic validation.
- Django chat UI renders progressive templates, and the FastAPI WebSocket handler
  (`monGARS/api/ws_manager.py`) now authenticates signed tickets issued by
  `/api/v1/auth/ws/ticket`, replays history, and streams responses when
  `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS` is true.
- Database-backed authentication is the default: `PersistenceRepository`
  persists user records, and login bootstrap flows now rely exclusively on
  persisted accounts after retiring the legacy demo credential mapping in
  `monGARS/api/web_api.py`.
- RAG dataset governance is documented and enforced through the catalog
  metadata pipeline.【F:docs/rag_dataset_governance.md†L1-L120】【F:models/datasets/governance.py†L41-L132】

## Phase 6 – Self-Improvement & Research (Completed Q1 2026)

- ✅ Personality profiles persist via SQLModel and reload into memory-backed
  caches on demand.
- ✅ SelfTrainingEngine batches curated records, persists anonymised datasets, and
  launches `modules.neurons.training.mntp_trainer.MNTPTrainer` for both curated
  linear adapters and LoRA fine-tuning when dependencies are available.
- ✅ Reinforcement learning research loops now live in
  `modules/neurons/training/reinforcement_loop.py`, complete with adaptive
  scaling strategies, OpenTelemetry spans, and metrics hooks. Production
  automation gates deployments through the operator approval registry so
  experiments cannot roll out without sign-off.【F:modules/neurons/training/reinforcement_loop.py†L1-L200】【F:monGARS/core/operator_approvals.py†L1-L200】
- ✅ ResearchLongHaulService orchestrates scheduled soak tests, deduplicates
  concurrent runs, and exposes the latest reinforcement summary for other
  services.【F:monGARS/core/research_validation.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/test_research_long_haul_service.py†L1-L200】
- ✅ Long-haul validation persists replica-load analytics and energy series for
  dashboards via the reinforcement observability store, with integration tests
  covering multi-replica and failure scenarios.【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】【F:tests/test_long_haul_validation.py†L200-L320】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L120-L320】

## Phase 7 – Sustainability & Longevity (Future)

- Evolution Engine orchestrates diagnostics and safe optimisation cycles, now
  backed by tangible adapter artefacts.
- ✅ Carbon-aware rollout policy consults sustainability telemetry before
  running evolution training cycles, deferring jobs when carbon intensity,
  approval backlogs, or incident counts breach guardrails, giving operators an
  actionable sustainability lever.【F:modules/evolution_engine/sustainability.py†L1-L235】【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L180-L360】
- Energy-usage reporting, advanced hardware-aware scaling, and cross-node sharing
  of optimisation artefacts remain open research topics.

## Key Contradictions & Actions

- ✅ **JWT alignment**: configuration and security manager now enforce HS256,
  deferring asymmetric keys until managed storage is available.
- ✅ **Secret storage**: Kubernetes manifests source credentials from Vault via
  an `ExternalSecret`, replacing inline Kubernetes `Secret` manifests.【F:k8s/secrets.yaml†L1-L52】
- ✅ **Schema evolution**: Alembic migrations cover every ORM model and legacy
  table, allowing production rollouts without `init_db.py` fallbacks.
- ✅ **Telemetry integration**: Ray Serve success, failure, and scaling counters
  are exported via OpenTelemetry and wired into peer telemetry broadcasts.
- ✅ **Credential hardening**: default demo accounts have been removed and the
  login bootstrap now relies exclusively on persisted accounts, with initial
  admin creation handled through the dedicated `/api/v1/user/register/admin`
  endpoint when no privileged accounts exist.
- ✅ **SDK story**: Python and TypeScript SDKs ship with documented release
  tooling, allowing partners to integrate without scraping OpenAPI definitions.【F:sdks/python/README.md†L1-L120】【F:docs/sdk-release-guide.md†L1-L160】
- ✅ **RAG governance**: curated datasets carry retention metadata, automated
  scrubbing checks, and operator playbooks covering exports and takedown flows.【F:docs/rag_dataset_governance.md†L1-L120】
- ✅ **Advanced research loops**: reinforcement-learning utilities emit
  telemetry, persist approval requests via
  `monGARS/core/operator_approvals.py`, and require explicit sign-off before
  manifests update, closing the long-standing milestone gap.
- ✅ **Long-haul automation**: ResearchLongHaulService and the observability store
  deliver unattended validation coverage plus durable telemetry feeds for RL
  dashboards.【F:monGARS/core/research_validation.py†L1-L200】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】

## Next Critical Implementation

Durable observability for the reinforcement loop is now in place: every
long-haul summary is persisted to
`models/encoders/reinforcement_observability.json`, correlating energy
telemetry, approval queues, and replica utilisation snapshots for dashboard
consumers.【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L120-L520】【F:tests/test_reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L62】
The energy tracker outputs now land alongside those observability feeds via
`SustainabilityDashboardBridge`, which writes
`models/encoders/sustainability_dashboard.json` and emits
`llm.sustainability.*` metrics so shared dashboards can correlate consumption,
approvals, and replica utilisation for every deployment decision.【F:monGARS/core/sustainability_dashboard.py†L1-L260】【F:monGARS/core/long_haul_validation.py†L120-L520】【F:tests/test_sustainability_dashboard.py†L1-L160】
Carbon-aware gating now enforces sustainability guardrails for training cycles.
The next focus is quantifying cross-node artefact reuse and translating
sustainability dashboards into hardware-aware placement hints so that energy
savings materialise across clusters.【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L260-L360】【F:modules/evolution_engine/orchestrator.py†L360-L520】【F:docs/codebase_status_report.md†L169-L214】
