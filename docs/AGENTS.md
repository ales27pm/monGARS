# Documentation Authoring Guide

> ⚠️ Auto-generated by `scripts/manage_agents.py`. Update `configs/agents/agents_config.json` and rerun the script instead of editing this file manually.

## Scope

Covers runbooks, API references, and architectural notes under `docs/`.

## Automation

- Generated via the agents manager script; edit the JSON profile and refresh after updating guidance.

## Roadmap Alignment

- **Operator Documentation**
  - ✅ FastAPI chat/history/token endpoints with validation.
  - ✅ Django chat UI with progressive enhancement.
  - ✅ FastAPI WebSocket handler with ticket verification, history replay, and streaming guarded by `WS_ENABLE_EVENTS`.
  - ✅ Replaced hard-coded credential stores with database-backed auth flows; FastAPI no longer seeds demo credentials at startup.【F:monGARS/api/web_api.py†L41-L120】
  - ✅ Publish polished SDKs and reference clients with documented release flows.【F:docs/sdk-release-guide.md†L1-L160】【F:docs/sdk-overview.md†L1-L120】
- **Sustainability Runbooks**
  - 🚧 Fully integrate evolution engine outputs into routine optimisation cycles.
  - 🚧 Automate energy usage reporting and advanced hardware-aware scaling using the energy tracker pipeline and reinforcement observability feeds as the baseline data source.【F:modules/evolution_engine/energy.py†L1-L160】【F:monGARS/core/reinforcement_observability.py†L1-L168】
  - 🚧 Share optimisation artefacts between nodes for faster convergence.

## Style & Accuracy

- Write in present tense, reference canonical module paths/tests, and refresh `Last updated` stamps
    when present.
- Include direct links to source files or diagrams so readers can jump to implementations quickly.

## Maintenance

- Update metrics, counts, and configuration tables when behaviour changes (e.g., test totals in
    `docs/testing.md`, deployment ports, feature flags).
- Document new configuration keys, sustainability controls, or operator workflows before declaring
    roadmap items complete.

## Cross-Linking

Cross-reference roadmap milestones and other docs when closing loops so contributors understand how
features land across API, core, modules, and webapp layers.
